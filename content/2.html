<h1> Importnce of TDD in application development </h1><br />
 <br />
Test Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative development process that ensures high quality of code. It is a process where developers write tests that validate the functionality of their code before they actually write the code. This process helps to ensure that the code is working as expected and any bugs or issues can be identified and corrected quickly.<br />
<br />
The main advantage of TDD is that it helps to maintain the quality of the code. With TDD, developers are able to identify bugs and errors in the code quickly and easily. Additionally, TDD helps to ensure that the code is written correctly and meets the requirements of the project.<br />
<br />
TDD also helps to improve the efficiency of developers. By writing tests first, developers can focus on the task at hand and identify any issues they may have while writing the code. This helps to reduce the amount of time spent debugging and refactoring code.<br />
<br />
Overall, TDD is an important part of any application development process. It helps to ensure that the code is of high quality and is working as expected. Additionally, TDD helps to reduce the amount of time spent debugging and refactoring code, which can help to improve the efficiency of developers.</body>
